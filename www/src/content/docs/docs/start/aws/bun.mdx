title: Bun on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Bun app to AWS with SST.
---

We are going to build an app with Bun, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it to AWS in a container with SST.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/aws-bun) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

#### Examples

We also have a few other Bun examples that you can refer to.

- [Deploy Bun with Elysia in a container](/docs/examples/#aws-bun-elysia-container)
- [Build a hit counter with Bun and Redis](/docs/examples/#aws-bun-redis)

---

## 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our Bun app.

```bash
mkdir aws-bun && cd aws-bun
bun init -y
```

---

#### Init Bun Serve

Replace your `index.ts` with the following.

```js title="index.ts"
const server = Bun.serve({
  async fetch(req) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/" && req.method === "GET") {
      return new Response("Hello World!");
    }

    return new Response("404!");
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on ${server.url}`);
```

This starts up an HTTP server by default on port `3000`.

---

#### Add scripts

Add the following to your `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "bun run --watch index.ts"
},
```

This adds a `dev` script with a watcher.

---

#### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
bunx sst init
bun install
```

This'll create an `sst.config.ts` file in your project root and install SST.

---

## 2. Add a Service

To deploy our Bun app, let's add an [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");

  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });
  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    loadBalancer: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "3000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "bun dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

:::note
By default, your service in not deployed when running in _dev_.
:::

The `dev.command` tells SST to instead run our Bun app locally in dev mode.

---

#### Start dev mode

Run the following to start dev mode. This'll start SST and your Bun app.

```bash
bun sst dev
```

Once complete, click on **MyService** in the sidebar and open your Bun app in your browser.

---

## 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add an S3 Bucket for file uploads. Add this to your `sst.config.ts` below the `Vpc` component.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
```

---

#### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [bucket],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the bucket in our Bun app.

---

## 4. Upload a file

We want a `POST` request made to the `/` route to upload a file to our S3 bucket. Let's add this below our _Hello World_ route in our `index.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts" {5}
if (url.pathname === "/" && req.method === "POST") {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("file")! as File;
  const params = {
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    ContentType: file.type,
    Key: file.name,
    Body: file,
  };
  const upload = new Upload({
    params,
    client: s3,
  });
  await upload.done();

  return new Response("File uploaded successfully.");
}
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Add the imports. We'll use the extra ones below.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import {
  S3Client,
  GetObjectCommand,
  ListObjectsV2Command,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { Upload } from "@aws-sdk/lib-storage";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";

const s3 = new S3Client();
```

And install the npm packages.

```bash
bun install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

---

## 5. Download the file

We'll add a `/latest` route that'll download the latest file in our S3 bucket. Let's add this below our upload route in `index.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts"
if (url.pathname === "/latest" && req.method === "GET") {
  const objects = await s3.send(
    new ListObjectsV2Command({
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    }),
  );
  const latestFile = objects.Contents!.sort(
    (a, b) =>
      (b.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0) - (a.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0),
  )[0];
  const command = new GetObjectCommand({
    Key: latestFile.Key,
    Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
  });
  return Response.redirect(await getSignedUrl(s3, command));
}
```

---

#### Test your app

To upload a file run the following from your project root.

```bash
curl -F file=@package.json http://localhost:3000/
```

This should upload the `package.json`. Now head over to `http://localhost:3000/latest` in your browser and it'll show you what you just uploaded.

---

## 6. Deploy your app

To deploy our app we'll first add a `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM oven/bun

COPY bun.lockb . 
COPY package.json . 

RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "index.ts"]
```

This is a pretty basic setup. You can refer to the [Bun docs](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/docker) for a more optimized Dockerfile.

:::tip
You need to be running [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to deploy your app.
:::

Let's also add a `.dockerignore` file in the root.

```bash title=".dockerignore"
node_modules
.git
.gitignore
README.md
Dockerfile*
```

Now to build our Docker image and deploy we run:

```bash
bun sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production. This'll give the URL of your Bun app deployed as a Fargate service.

```bash
✓  Complete
   MyService: http://prod-MyServiceLoadBalanc-491430065.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

Congrats! Your app should now be live!

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and view logs from it.

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
