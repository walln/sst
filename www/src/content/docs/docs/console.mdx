description: Manage and monitor your apps with the SST Console.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Console is a web based dashboard to manage your SST apps. With it you can **invoke functions**, **debug issues**, **view logs**, and **_git push to deploy_** your apps, with your team — [**console.sst.dev**](https://console.sst.dev)

[![SST Console](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-home.png)](https://console.sst.dev)

:::tip
The Console is completely optional and comes with a generous free tier.
:::

---

## Get started

Start by creating an account and connecting your AWS account.

:::note
Currently the Console only supports apps **deployed to AWS**.
:::

1. **Create an account with your email**

   It's better to use your work email so that you can invite your team to your workspace later — [**console.sst.dev**](https://console.sst.dev)

2. **Create a workspace**
   
   You can add your apps and invite your team to a workspace. A workspace can be for a personal project or for your team at work. You can create as many workspaces as you want.

   :::tip
   Create a workspace for your organization. You can use it to invite your team and connect all your AWS accounts.
   :::

2. **Connect your AWS account**

   This will ask you to create a CloudFormation stack in your AWS account. Make sure that this stack is being added to **us-east-1**. Scroll down and click **Create stack**.

   :::caution
   The CloudFormation stack needs to be created in **us-east-1**. If you create it in the wrong region by mistake, remove it and create it again.
   :::

   This stack will scan all the regions in your account for SST apps and subscribe to them. Once created, you'll see all your apps, stages, and the functions in the apps.

3. **Invite your team**

   Use the email address of your teammates to invite them. They just need to login with the email you've used and they'll be able to join your workspace.

---

## How it works

At a high level, here's how the Console works.

- It's hosted on our side

  It stores some metadata about what resources you have deployed. We'll have a version that can be self-hosted in the future.

- You can view all your apps and stages

  Once you've connected your AWS accounts, it'll deploy a separate CloudFormation stack and connect to any SST apps in it. And all your apps and stages will show up automatically.

- You can manage your apps

  You can view all the functions in your app. You can view all the issues in your functions in real-time with the source maps automatically applied. You can view their logs, invoke them, or replay invocations. You can also save event payloads to your workspace.

  For your functions running [Live](/docs/live/), the logs will be streamed in real-time from your local machine.

- It's open-source and built with SST

  The Console is an SST app. You can view the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/sst/console). It's also auto-deployed using itself.

---

## Security

The CloudFormation stack that the Console uses, creates an IAM Role in your account to manage your resources. If this is a concern for your production environments, we have a couple of options.

By default, this role is granted `AdministratorAccess`, but you can customize it to restrict access. We'll look at this below. Additionally, if you'd like us to sign a BAA, feel free to [contact us][contact-us].

There maybe cases where you don't want any data leaving your AWS account. For this, we'll be supporting self-hosting the Console in the future.

---

#### IAM permissions

Permissions for the Console fall into two categories: read and write:

- **Read Permissions**: The Console needs specific permissions to display information about resources within your SST apps.

  | Purpose                                | AWS IAM Action                   |
  |----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Fetch stack outputs                    | `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`  |
  | Retrieve function runtime and size     | `lambda:GetFunction`      |
  | Access stack metadata                  | `ec2:DescribeRegions`<br/>`s3:GetObject`<br/>`s3:ListBucket`|
  | Display function logs                  | `logs:DescribeLogStreams`<br/>`logs:FilterLogEvents`<br/>`logs:GetLogEvents`<br/>`logs:StartQuery`|
  | Monitor invocation usage               | `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`       |

  Attach the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess` AWS managed policy to the IAM Role for comprehensive read access.

- **Write Permissions**: The Console requires the following write permissions.

  | Purpose                                          | AWS IAM Action                                                               |
  |-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Forward bootstrap bucket events to event bus     | `s3:PutBucketNotification`                                      |
  | Send events to Console                       | `events:PutRule`<br/>`events:PutTargets`                           |
  | Grant event bus access for Console           | `iam:CreateRole`<br/>`iam:DeleteRole`<br/>`iam:DeleteRolePolicy`<br/>`iam:PassRole`<br/>`iam:PutRolePolicy` |
  | Enable Issues to subscribe logs                  | `logs:CreateLogGroup`<br/>`logs:PutSubscriptionFilter` |
  | Invoke Lambda functions and replay invocations   | `lambda:InvokeFunction` |


It's good practice to periodically review and update these policies.

---

#### Customize policy

To customize IAM permissions for the CloudFormation stack:

1. On the CloudFormation create stack page, download the default `template.json`.

2. Edit the template file with necessary changes.

   <details>
   <summary>_View the template changes_</summary>
   
     ```diff title="template.json"

             ]
           }
         }
     ```
   
   </details>

3. Upload your edited `template.json` file to an S3 bucket.

4. Return to the CloudFormation create stack page and replace the template URL in the page URL.

## Pricing

[Starting Feb 1, 2025](/blog/console-pricing-update), the Console will be priced based on the number of active resources in your SST apps.

| Resources | Rate per resource |
|-----------|-----------|
| First 2000   | $0.086  |
| 2000+        | $0.032 |

**Free Tier**: Workspaces with 350 active resources or fewer.

So for example, if you go over the free tier and have 351 active resources in a month, your bill will be 351 x $0.086 = $30.2.

A couple of things to note.

- These are calculated for a given workspace every month.
- A resource is what SST creates in your cloud provider. [Learn more below](#faq).
- You can always access personal stages, even if you're above the free tier.
- If you haven't deployed to a stage in a month, its resources won't count as active.
- For volume pricing, feel free to [contact us][contact-us].

---

#### Old pricing

Previously, the Console pricing was based on the number of times the Lambda functions in your SST apps are invoked per month and it used the following tiers.

| Invocations | Rate (per invocation) |
|-------------|------|
| First 1M    | Free |
| 1M - 10M    | $0.00002 |
| 10M+        | $0.000002 |

- These are calculated for a given workspace on a monthly basis.
- This does not apply to personal stages, they'll be free forever.
- There's also a soft limit for Issues on all accounts.
- For volume pricing, feel free to [contact us][contact-us].

---

## Features

Here are a few of the things the Console does for you.

1. [**Logs**](#logs): View logs from the functions in your app
2. [**Issues**](#issues): Get real-time alerts for any errors in your functions
3. [**Local logs**](#local-logs): View logs from your local `sst dev` session
4. [**Resources**](#resources): View the resources in your app and their history
5. [**Autodeploy**](#autodeploy): Auto-deploy your app when you _git push_ to your repo

---

### Logs

With the Console, you don't need to go to CloudWatch to look at the logs for your functions, containers and other log groups. You can view:

- Past logs
- Live logs
- Jump to a specific time

![SST Console logs](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-logs.png)

---

### Issues

The Console will automatically show you any errors in your Node.js Lambda functions in real-time. And notify you through Slack or email.

![SST Console Issues](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-issues.png)

With Issues, there is:

- **Nothing to setup**, no code to instrument
- **Source maps** are supported **automatically**
- **No impact on performance** or cold starts, since the functions aren't modified

:::note
Issues works out of the box and has no impact on performance or cold starts.
:::

Issues currently only supports Node.js functions. Other runtimes and containers are on the roadmap.

---

#### Error detection

Issues reports Lambda function failures. In addition, for Node.js it reports errors that are logged using `console.error(new Error("my-error"))`.

:::tip
In Node.js functions you can use `console.error` to report your errors.
:::

For the Console to automatically report your errors, you need to pass in an error object with the `console.error` call.

```js title="src/lambda.ts"
console.error(new Error("my-error"));
```

---

#### How it works

Here's how Issues works behind the scenes.

1. When an app is deployed or when an account is first synced, we add a log subscriber to the CloudWatch Log groups in your SST apps.
   - This is added to your AWS account and includes a Lambda function. More on this below.
2. If the subscriber filter matches anything that looks like an error it invokes the Lambda function.
3. The Lambda function tries to parse the error and fetches the source maps from the state bucket in your account.
4. It then hits an endpoint in the SST Console and passes in that error.
5. Finally, the Console groups similar looking errors together and displays them.

---

#### Log subscriber

The log subscriber also includes the following:

1. **Lambda function** that'll be invoked when a log with an error is matched.
   - This function has a max concurrency set to 10.
   - If it falls behind on processing by over 10 minutes, it'll discard the logs.
   - This prevents it from scaling indefinitely when there's a burst of errors.
   - This also means that if there are a lot of errors, the alerts might be delayed by up to 10 minutes.
2. **IAM role** that gives it access to query the logs and the state bucket for the source maps.
3. **Log group** with a 1 day retention.

These are added to **every region** in your AWS account that has a CloudWatch log group from your SST apps. It's deployed using a CloudFormation stack.

This process of adding a log subscriber might fail if we:

- Don't have enough permissions. In this case, update the permissions that you've granted to the Console.
- Hit the limit for the number of subscribers, there's a maximum of 2 subscribers. To fix this, you can remove one of the existing subscribers.

You can see these errors in the Issues tab. Once you've fixed these issues, you can hit **Retry** and it'll try attaching the subscriber again. 

---

#### Costs

AWS will bill you for the Lambda function log subscriber that's in your account. This is usually fairly minimal.

Even if your apps are generating an infinite number of errors, the Lambda function is limited to a concurrency of 10. So the **maximum** you'll be charged $43 x 10 = **$430 per month x # of regions** that are being monitored.

You can also disable Issues from your workspace settings, if you are using a separate service for monitoring.

[Learn more about Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/).

---

### Local logs

When the Console starts up, it checks if you are running `sst dev` locally. If so, then it'll show you real-time logs from your local terminal. This works by connecting to a local server that's run as a part of the SST CLI.

![SST Console local logs](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-local.png)

:::info
The local server only allows access from `localhost` and `console.sst.dev`.
:::

The local logs works in all browsers and environments. But for certain browsers like Safari or Brave, and Gitpod, it needs some additional configuration.

---

#### Safari & Brave

Certain browsers like Safari and Brave require the local connection between the browser and the `sst dev` CLI to be running on HTTPS.

SST can automatically generate a locally-trusted certificate using the [`sst cert`](/docs/reference/cli#cert) command.

```bash
sst cert
```

You'll only need to **run this once** on your machine.

---

#### Gitpod

If you are using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), you can use the Gitpod Local Companion app to connect to the `sst dev`  process running inside your Gitpod workspace.

To get started:

1. [Install Gitpod Local Companion app](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app#installation)
2. [Run the Companion app](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app#running)
3. Navigate to Console in the browser

The companion app runs locally and creates a tunnelled connection to your Gitpod workspace.

---

### Resources

The Console shows you the complete [state of the resources](/docs/state/) in your app. You can view:

1. Each resource in your app 
2. The relation between resources
3. The outputs of a given resource
4. The full URN of the resource
5. The update where the resource was created or modified

![SST Console resources](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-resources.png)

---

#### Update history

The Console also tracks all the updates that were made to your app. And the resources that were modified as a part of the update.

It also shows the SST command that was run that triggered the update. If the update was a part of an [Autodeploy](#autodeploy), it shows the related git commit as well.

---

### Autodeploy

The Console can auto-deploy your apps when you _git push_ to your GitHub repo. Autodeploy uses [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) in your account to run the build.

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../assets/docs/console/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

We designed Autodeploy to be a better fit for SST apps when compared to alternatives like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.

1. **Easy to get started**
   - Autodeploy supports the standard branch and PR workflow out of the box. You don't need a config file to get started.
   - There are no complicated steps in configuring your AWS credentials; since your AWS account is already connected to the Console.
2. **Configurable**
   - You can configure how Autodeploy works directly through your `sst.config.ts`.
   - It's typesafe and the callbacks let you customize how to respond to incoming git events.
3. **Runs in your AWS account**
   - The builds are run in your AWS account.
   - It can also be configured to run in your VPC. This is useful if your builds need to access private resources.
4. **Integrates with the Console**
   - You can see which resources were updated in a deploy.
   - Your resource updates will also show you the related git commit.

---

#### Setup

To get started with Autodeploy:

1. **Enable the GitHub integration**

   Head over to your **Workspace settings** >  **Integrations** and enable GitHub. This will ask you to login to GitHub and you'll be asked to pick the GitHub organization or user you want to link to.

   :::tip
   You can only associate your workspace with a single GitHub org.
   :::

   If you have multiple GitHub orgs, you can create multiple workspaces in the Console.

2. **Connect a repo**

   To auto-deploy an app, head over to the **App's Settings** > **Autodeploy** and select the repo for the app.

3. **Configure an environment**

   Next you can configure a branch or PR environment by selecting the **stage** you want deployed to an **AWS account**. You can optionally configure **environment variables** as well.

   :::note
   Stage names by default are generated based on the branch or PR.
   :::

   By default, stages are based on the branch name or PR. We'll look at this in detail below.

4. **Git push**

   Finally, _git push_ to the environment you configured and head over to your app's **Autodeploy** tab to see it in action.

   :::note
   PR stages are removed when the PR is closed while branch stages are not.
   :::

   For example, if you configure a branch environment for the stage `production`, any git pushes to the `production` branch will be auto-deployed. Similarly, if you create a new PR, say PR#12, the Console will auto-deploy a stage called `pr-12`.

   You can also manually trigger a deployment through the Console by passing in a Git ref and the stage you want to deploy to.

5. **Setup alerts**

   Once your deploys are working, you can set the Console to send alerts for your deploys. Head over to your **Workspace Settings** > **Alerts** and add a new alert to be notified on any Autodeploys, or only on Autodeploy errors.

:::tip
You can configure how Autodeploy works through your `sst.config.ts`.
:::

While Autodeploy supports the standard branch and PR workflow out of the box, it can be configured in depth through your `sst.config.ts`.

---

#### Configure

The above can be configured through the [`console.autodeploy`](/docs/reference/config/#console-autodeploy) option in the `sst.config.ts`.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {7-15}
export default $config({
  // Your app's config
  app(input) { },
  // Your app's resources
  async run() { },
  // Your app's Console config
  console: {
    autodeploy: {
      target(event) {
        if (event.type === "branch" && event.branch === "main" && event.action === "pushed") {
          return { stage: "production" };
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

In the above example we are using the `console.autodeploy.target` option to change the stage that's tied to a git event. Only git pushes to the `main` branch to auto-deploy to the `production` stage.

This works because if `target` returns `undefined`, the deploy is skipped. And if you provide your own `target` callback, it overrides the default behavior.

:::tip
You can use the git events to configure how your app is auto-deployed.
:::

Through the `console.autodeploy.runner` option, you can configure the runner that's used. For example, if you wanted to increase the timeouts to 2 hours, you can.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
console: {
  autodeploy: {
    runner: { timeout: "2 hours" }
  }
}
```

This also takes the stage name, so you can set the runner config for a specific stage.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
console: {
  autodeploy: {
    runner(stage) {
      if (stage === "production") return { timeout: "3 hours" };
    }
  }
}
```

You can also have your builds run inside your VPC.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
console: {
  autodeploy: {
    runner: {
      vpc: {
        id: "vpc-0be8fa4de860618bb",
        securityGroups: ["sg-0399348378a4c256c"],
        subnets: ["subnet-0b6a2b73896dc8c4c", "subnet-021389ebee680c2f0"]
      }
    }
  }
} 
```

Or specify files and directories to be cached.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
console: {
  autodeploy: {
    runner: {
      cache: {
        paths: ["node_modules", "/path/to/cache"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Read more about the [`console.autodeploy`](/docs/reference/config/#console-autodeploy) config.

---

#### Environments

The Console needs to know which account it needs to autodeploy into. You configure this under the **App's Settings** > **Autodeploy**. Each environment takes:

1. **Stage**

   The stage that is being deployed. By default, the stage name comes from the name of the branch. Branch names are sanitized to only letters/numbers and hyphens. So for example:
   - A push to a branch called `production` will deploy a stage called `production`.
   - A push to PR#12 will deploy to a stage called `pr-12`.

   As mentioned, above you can customize this through your `sst.config.ts`.

   :::tip
   You can specify a pattern to match the stage name in your environments.
   :::

   If multiple stages share the same environment, you can use a glob pattern. For example, `pr-*` matches all stages that start with `pr-`.

2. **AWS Account**

   The AWS account that you are deploying to.

3. **Environment Variables**

   Any environment variables you need for the build process. These are made available under `process.env.*` in your `sst.config.ts`.

---

#### How it works

When you _git push_ to a branch, pull request, or tag, the following happens:

1. The stage name is generated based on the `console.autodeploy.target` callback.
   1. If there is no callback, the stage name is a sanitized version of the branch or tag.
   2. If there is a callback but no stage is returned, the deploy is skipped.
2. The stage is matched against the environments in the Console to get the AWS account and any environment variables for the deploy.
3. The runner config is generated based on the `console.autodeploy.runner`. Or the defaults are used.
4. The deploy is run based on the above config.

This only applies only to git events. If you trigger a deploy through the Console, you are asked to specify the stage you want to deploy to. So in this case, it skips step 1 from above and does not call `console.autodeploy.target`.

Both `target` and `runner` are optional and come with defaults, but they can be customized.

## FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about the Console.

- Do I need to use the Console to use SST?

  You **don't need the Console** to use SST. It compliments the CLI and has some features that help with managing your apps in production.

  That said, it is completely free to get started. You can create an account and invite your team, **without** having to add a **credit card**.

- Is there a free tier?

  If your workspace has 350 active resources or fewer for the month, it's considered to be in the free tier. This count also resets every month.

- What happens if I go over the free tier?

  You won't be able to access the _production_ or deployed stages till you add your billing details in the workspace settings.

  Note that, you can continue to **access your personal stages**. Just make sure you have `sst dev` running locally. Otherwise the Console won't be able to detect that it's a personal stage.

- What counts as a resource?

  Resources are what SST creates in your cloud provider. This includes the resources created by both SST's built-in components, like `Function`, `Nextjs`, `Bucket`, and the ones created by any other Terraform/Pulumi provider.

  Some components, like `Nextjs` and `StaticSite`, create multiple resources. In general, the more complex the component, the more resources it'll create.

  You can see a [full list of resources](#resources) if you go to an app in your Console and navigate to a stage in it.

  For some context, the Console is itself a pretty large [SST app](https://github.com/sst/console) and it has around 320 resources.

- How are active resource counted?

  At the start of every month, or billing cycle, the Console will track the stages that have been updated. All the resources in these stages are considered active for the month.

  However, if the only update to a stage in a month was to remove it, the resources in that stage will not be counted as being active.

#### Old pricing FAQ

Here were some frequently asked questions about the old pricing plan for the Console.

- Do I need to switch to the new pricing?

   If you are currently on the old plan, you don't have to switch and you won't be automatically switched over either.

   You can go to the workspace settings and check out how much you'll be billed based on both the plans. To switch over, you can cancel your current plan and then subscribe to the new plan.

   At some point in the future, we'll remove the old plan. But there's no specific timeline for it yet.

- Which Lambda functions are included in the number of invocations?

  The number of invocations are only counted for the **Lambda functions in your SST apps**. Other Lambda functions in your AWS accounts are not included.

- Do the functions in my personal stages count as a part of the invocations?

  Lambda functions that are invoked **locally are not included**.

- My invocation volume is far higher than the listed tiers. Are there any other options?
