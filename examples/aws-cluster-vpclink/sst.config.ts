/**
 * ## AWS Cluster with API Gateway
 *
 * Expose a service through API Gateway HTTP API using a VPC link.
 *
 * This is an alternative to using a load balancer. Since API Gateway is pay per request, it
 * works out a lot cheaper for services that don't get a lot of traffic.
 *
 * You need to specify which port in your service will be exposed through API Gateway.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4}
 * const service = new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   serviceRegistry: {
 *     port: 80,
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Your API Gateway HTTP API also needs to be in the same VPC as the service.
